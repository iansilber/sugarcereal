				<h1>Sugar Cereal? Huh?</h1>
				<p>Sugar Cereal is the spotlight of the internet.</p>
				<p>Every day we take the winning bid and highlight it at center stage. If your bid successfully wins that day's contest, we will direct a laser beam of people visiting anything you’ve posted for the next 24 hours. It’s a great way to get exposure for anything you would like to exposure for. Whether you’d like more people to see your camping photos or to visit a new site you’ve just launched, Sugar Cereal is there for you. How great would it be to send a swarm of people over to your mom’s one YouTube video where she’s cooking her famous rhubarb pie? Who knows, maybe you can take that pie from household famous to World famous!</p>
				<p>Now there are a few exceptions, we will not accept any URLs that contain nudity, illegal activities, spam, URL shorteners or offensive content (I guess that means don’t offend us). So don’t make us have to cancel your bid by violating these. That just makes us pouty, and nobody likes to be pouty. </p>
				<p>Sugar Cereal is derived from the experience you would get when opening a box of your favorite cereal. What was the first thing you did? You fished out the toy of course, and it was always a fun surprise. That’s exactly what we’d like to create everyday, a fun surprise for you to discover and brighten your day with, so tell your friends about us, and visit often to see what comes out of the box!</p>
				<p>Now go enjoy a bowl or two, and don’t let the cereal milk get warm.</p>
